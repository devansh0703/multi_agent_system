Subject: URGENT - My service is still down and nobody is helping!

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my extreme frustration with your service. My internet has been down for over 48 hours now, and despite multiple calls to your customer service line, the issue remains unresolved. Your representatives keep giving me generic excuses and no one seems to have a concrete solution.

This is impacting my work severely. I need this fixed immediately. If this isn't resolved within the next 4 hours, I will be forced to switch providers and share my terrible experience on social media.

This is completely unacceptable!

Sincerely,
A Very Upset Customer
